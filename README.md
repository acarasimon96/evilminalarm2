# Evil Minutes of the Clock Alarms

A highly precise and customizable alarm that plays a sound at certain minutes of every hour as well as specific times of the day.

For example, you can make this app play a sound every :59 minutes past the hour or at 10:00 and 18:00 every day.

Run with `python -m evilminalarm`. For the best possible accuracy, it's recommended to run this app on Python 3.11 or later.
